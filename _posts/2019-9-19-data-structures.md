### Why use Cassandra?

##### When to use Cassandra

##### When to not use Cassandra

### Glossary

<a name="LinearScalability"></a> **Linear scalability** - scalability by resource per throughput in a linear graph 
ex. pay 5\$ per month for 50 op/s and when pay 10\$ per month it can get 100 op/s

<a name="FaultTolerance"></a> **Fault tolerance** - the property that prevents operating failure when some of the components is failing that could be a problem from hardware or software.
