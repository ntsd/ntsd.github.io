## Installations

### Install Gatsby and generate website

if you're beginner you should follow the getting start from Gatsby

<https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/>

I'll skip this step because it too easy

``` Shell
# Install the Gatsby CLI
npm install -g gatsby-cli

# Create a new site
gatsby new gatsby-site

# Change directories into site folder
cd gatsby-site

# gatsby develop
gatsby develop
```

### Make Gatsby support TypeScript
